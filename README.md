This is a Web Scrapping Project. It scrapes the job listings from Tim Hortons, a famous coffee chain. The data is stored in an excel file. This python script utilizes the requests library to make a GET request to the Tim Hortons job listings API. It then processes the JSON response and extracts relevant information, storing it in a Pandas DataFrame. Finally, the script exports the DataFrame to an Excel file named 'Tim_Hortons_Job.xlsx'.
